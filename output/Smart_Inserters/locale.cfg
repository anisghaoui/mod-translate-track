si-range-adder = __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__“Inserter"__REMARK_COLOR_END__ each inserter is going to be limited to its range and also be limited by the max range (work best with diagonal technology on, note that if the max range is 1 and the inserter ha range 2 it will not be editable) \n __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__"Incremental"__REMARK_COLOR_END__ each inserter will have its range + an increment given by the tech <=max range (work best with range and diagonal technologies) \n __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__"Equal”__REMARK_COLOR_END__ every inserter will have the same range (the max range) (work best with range and diagonal technologies) \n__REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__"Rebase"__REMARK_COLOR_END__ each inserter will have its minimum range updated to it's default range, max range will be the one you decide in the settings (an inserter of range 2 will not be able to place of pick item at range 1) \n__REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__"incremental-with-rebase"__REMARK_COLOR_END__ same as incremental but inetsad of using the base range the increment start after the rebase \n __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__"inserter-with-rebase"__REMARK_COLOR_END__ similar to incremental-with-rebase but instead of adding an increment to the min range it unlock teh range up to the max range (if you want to allow inserter to change position only in their default range set the max range to 1)
